# phpcourse-project

A project I did for my PHP course in university that is a very simple and not fully functional Instagram type of platform.
That means there are users that can post pictures using its URL and can view other users' pictures, also with registration and login.
Created this project using XAMPP to host my database and to use PHP.
Created a database with users and pictures, created the PHP scripts that are essentially the 'server' that handle which pictures are shown, showing the users, registration, login, etc.
Used the Capture template to focus on the PHP code.
